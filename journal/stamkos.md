excerpt: Stamkos full practice participant

---
Stamkos was a full practice participant, per Stephen Whyno via <a href="https://twitter.com/SWhyno/status/1287856118618783746">Twitter</a>.

Tampa Bay's captain isn't sure if the lower-body injury, which he suffered during Phase 2 of the restart, was related to his muscle surgery this past March.

This is a welcomed sight for the Lighting, who will take on the Washington Capitals on August 3rd in the first of three games to determine playoff seeding.
